# What is deep Learning 
A type of [[ðŸ–¥ Machine Learning]] based on [[Artificial neural network]] in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher level features from a data .

-  Deep learning is sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function if the brain's neural networks.
- As a sub field of ML, DL also uses algorithms to analyse data, learn from that data , and then make a determination or perdition about new data

# Why use [[ðŸ–¥ Machine Learning]] (or Deep learning )

__Good reason :__ **~~Why not ?~~**

__Better reason :__ for a complex problem, we need think to think all the possible rules which is not possible. 

A wise software engineer... (actually rule 1 of [Google's Machine Learning Handbook ](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/)) said : 

> if you can build a ==_simple rule based_== system that doesnâ€™t require machine learning, do that .


# What is deep Learning is good for ?
- __Problems with long lists of rules__ - when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep learning may help.

- __Continually changing environments__ - deep learning can adapt ('learn') to new scenarios.

- __Discovering insights within large collections of data__  - can you imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food , objects , things look like? it will be a nightmare .
