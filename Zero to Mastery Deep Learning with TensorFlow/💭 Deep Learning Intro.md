# What is deep Learning 
A type of [[ðŸ–¥ Machine Learning]] based on [[Artificial neural network]] in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher level features from a data .

-  Deep learning is sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function if the brain's neural networks.
- As a sub field of ML, DL also uses algorithms to analyse data, learn from that data , and then make a determination or perdition about new data

# Why use [[ðŸ–¥ Machine Learning]] (or Deep learning )

Good reason : Why not ?
